This code has been developed and used mainly on pc-linux platform, however,
it should compile on other platforms. Beware that the configure script 
currently does not do much more than a couple of checks. It should be viewed 
rather as a prototype for the future than a multi-platform configuration tool.

To compile, run:

configure
make
(make install)

Apart from the `csa' library, this code contains `csabathy' -- an 
approximation utility based on `csa'. 

For quick tests or examples, see ./examples.

From version 1.09, `csa' can take advantage of estimated standard deviation of
data, fitting spline closer to points with smaller measurement errors. If you 
use `csabathy', enter estimated standard deviations in the 4th column (see 
example 3). (If no data entered on a line, the previous value is used; the
abscence/presence of a value in the 4th column of the first valid line is used
as a flag whether this data is presented). If you use the library, use 
csa_addstd() to submit this data; similar to the point data (X Y Z), the 
library holds only a shallow copy of this data; the total number of error 
values entered before calling csa_calculatespline() should match the total 
number of points. See svd.[c,h] for more details on the fitting technique.
