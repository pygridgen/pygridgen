v. 1.68, 28 September 2006
        -- Edited README
v. 1.69, 22 November 2006
	-- Substantial changes in processing of the degenerate case for Sibson
           interpolation. This is the case when an interpolation point is close
           to being in between data points. It is no longer handled by a pair
           of symmetric displacements of this point; instead, the center of the
           corresponding circumcircle is moved elsewhere in a specific way.
v. 1.70, 24 November 2006
        -- Added example 6.
v. 1.71, 17 January 2006
	-- Made the test on whether an output point exactly coincides with
           an input point in nnpi_triangle_process() approximate.
