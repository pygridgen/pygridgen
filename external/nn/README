This code has been developed and used mainly on pc-linux platform, however,
it should compile on other platforms. Beware that the configure script 
currently does not do much more than a couple of checks. It should be viewed 
rather as a prototype for the future than a multi-platform configuration tool.

To compile, run:

configure
make
(make install)

For a few quick tests, run:

make tests
./nnphi_test
./nnai_test
./ht_test

Apart from the `nn' library, this code contains `nnbathy' -- a simple 
interpolation utility/example based on `nn'.

There are a number of examples of using `nnbathy' in "examples" directory:

examples/1 -- reconstruction of Franke test function
examples/2 -- reconstruction of bathymetry from sonar data
examples/3 -- performance on degenerate data
examples/4 -- reconstruction of topography from satellite altimeter data
examples/5 -- reconstruction of topography from digitised contours

For a basic description of structures and functions available from `nn', have
a look at "nn.h".

Acknowledgments:

This library uses the following public code/algorithms:
  1. `triangle' by Jonathan Richard Shewchuk -- for Delaunay triangulation;
  2. Dave Watson's algorithm for Sibson interpolation;
  3. Belikov and Semenov's formulas for non-Sibsonian interpolation.
